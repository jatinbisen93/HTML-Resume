<h3>JAVA :-</h3>
<p> <b>Java[a] is one of the Greater Sunda Islands in Indonesia</b>. It is bordered  by the <em> Indian Ocean </em> to the south and the Java Sea to the north. With a population of 156.4 million people, Java is the world's most populous island, home to approximately 56% of the Indonesian population.[2] Indonesia's capital city, Jakarta, is on Java's northwestern coast.Many of the best known events in Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally. Four of Indonesia's eight UNESCO world heritage sites are located in Java: Ujung Kulon National Park, Borobudur Temple, Prambanan Temple, and Sangiran Early Man Site.</p>  <br>

Perhaps the "programming program" you refer to is a compiler or interpreter for this. --Jwinius (talk) 15:47, 28 December 2007 (UTC)
python is a open source software and easy to use Ykajal65 (talk) 11:13, 21 October 2018 (UTC).Python (programming language) should without doubt be moved to Python, and the disambiguation page linked from the top of that article. Regardless of what the "core" meaning of Python is, browsing through the top (non-wikipedia) google hits shows that at least on the Internet, python is a programming language. </p>
